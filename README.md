# Task 5 - Decision Trees & Random Forests

This is part of my AI & ML internship.  
In this task, I worked with the Heart Disease Dataset and trained tree-based models.

## What I did:
- Trained a Decision Tree Classifier
- Visualized the tree structure
- Tried different depths to reduce overfitting
- Trained a Random Forest Classifier
- Compared both models
- Plotted feature importance
- Used cross-validation for checking accuracy

## Dataset:
Heart Disease Dataset (from Kaggle)

## Tools Used:
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn

## Conclusi
